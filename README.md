## Overview

PoeWatch is a Path of Exile statistics and price data collection page that's been in the works since 2017. It gathers data over time for various items (such as uniques, gems, currency, you name it) from public trade listings and finds the average prices. The site is actively in development and welcomes any feedback users may have.

## The general idea

The general goal was to make a statistics website with everything in one place. Users can check prices of almost any item type from the current or past leagues and look up character names.

## Setup

Crude set up instructions can be found in `DEPLOYMENT.md`. Do note that at the current moment these are no more than personal notes that contain unnecessary or missing information for first time setup.

## HW requirements

The backend is relatively lightweight and can run on a regular $4 VPS. SSD with high IOPS is recommended.
